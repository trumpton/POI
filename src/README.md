# POI
Points of Interest and Track management.

This program is capable of managing points of interest files, which are saved in both .gpx and .ov2 formats for Garmin and TomTom GPSs.
In addition, it is capable of managing .gpx tracks (with waypoints).
The program can import and export tracks from/to a filesystem mounted Garmin GPS, such as the E-Trex series.  Exporting to a TomTom GPS launches and uses a third party web browser.

When walking tracks are saved, the first waypoint on the track is also saved to a tracks.gpx, and tracks.ov2 file, which is particularly useful if the first point on a walk is accessed by car.

This program is provided free of charge, and no warranty or guarantees are offered.
